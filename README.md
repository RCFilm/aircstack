# AircStack

A Docker-native reverse proxy with DNS auto-sync for IONOS (or other providers).

## Features

- üîê HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
- üì° Auto DNS A-record creation via provider API (IONOS by default)
- üß† Detects containers using Docker label: \`traefik.domain\`
- ü™µ Detailed logging and robust error handling in the DNS sync service


## Usage

1. Copy and edit environment values:
   \`\`\`
   cp .env.example .env
# edit .env to set EMAIL and DOMAIN
# optional: SYNC_INTERVAL (seconds between DNS checks)
   cp config/provider.example.json config/provider.json
# edit config/provider.json with your DNS provider credentials
   \`\`\`

2. Launch the stack:
   \`\`\`
   docker compose up --build -d
   \`\`\`

The DNS watcher service is built from `dns-sync/Dockerfile` and will
periodically ensure A records exist for containers that specify the
`traefik.domain` label.

DNS provider credentials are read from `config/provider.json`. The control
panel includes a **DNS Provider Settings** page where you can edit the API key,
root domain and target IP. Only IONOS is supported currently but the format is
ready for additional providers.

### Control panel

The stack now includes a small control panel served at
`https://control.${DOMAIN}`. Use it to toggle public routing for your running
containers and inspect the live log from the DNS watcher.

### Portainer extension

The stack ships with a Portainer extension for the control panel. It is mounted
into Portainer automatically so no manual import is required. As soon as the
stack starts, the "Proxy Control" tab is available in Portainer running the
same Flask app on port 5000. When exposing a container, leaving the subdomain
blank will default it to the container name.
